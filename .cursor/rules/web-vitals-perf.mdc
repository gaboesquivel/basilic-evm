# Web Vitals & Performance Rules

## Core Metrics
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals:
  - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
  - FID (First Input Delay) < 100ms
  - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
- Use Server Components as default for improved performance
- Minimize client-side JavaScript bundle size
