## Development Conventions and AI Workflow

We leverage various AI-powered tools to enhance development speed and efficiency:

1. **[Cursor.so](https://cursor.so/) AI Editor**: Our primary code editor for AI-assisted development. Our code style guidelines are detailed in the [.cursorrules](./.cursorrules) file. It is crucial that all team members read and understand these conventions to maintain consistency and efficiency in our development process.

   Key Cursor.so commands:
   - **Prompt an edit**: Highlight code and press Cmd+K
   - **Accept autocomplete**: Press Tab when a suggestion appears
   - **Ask a question**: Use Cmd+L to open chat, @ to import files/docs
   - **Focus AI on code**: Highlight code and press Cmd+Shift+L

   For more features, visit [cursor.sh/features](https://cursor.sh/features). For support, post on [forum.cursor.sh](https://forum.cursor.sh/).

   We recommend using the Claude Sonnet API key in Cursor settings, as this model has shown superiority when dealing with code.

2. **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev/)**: We use this tool to rapidly generate markup for components, streamlining UI development.

3. **[postgres.new](https://postgres.new/)**: This tool assists in database work, allowing for quick schema design and query testing.

These AI-powered tools significantly accelerate our development process, enabling us to focus more on core functionality and complex problem-solving.
